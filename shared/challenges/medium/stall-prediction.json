  "description": "Stall is one of the most critical phenomena in aerodynamics - when an airfoil loses lift due to flow separation. Understanding stall is essential for aircraft safety.\n\n**Your Task**: Find the stall angle of the NACA 0012 airfoil at Re=1e6. Run a polar sweep from 0° to 20° and identify:\n1. The angle where CL reaches its maximum (CLmax)\n2. The stall angle (where CL starts decreasing)\n3. The maximum CL value\n\n**Learning Objectives**:\n- Understand flow separation and stall mechanics\n- Interpret lift curve behavior near stall\n- Analyze Cp distributions to identify separation\n- Learn about CLmax and its importance\n\n**Success Criteria**: \n- Find CLmax between 1.40 and 1.50\n- Identify stall angle between 13° and 16°\n- Demonstrate understanding of separation patterns",

    "Run a polar sweep using XFoil from α=0° to α=20° in 0.5° or 1° increments",
    "Plot CL vs α and look for the peak - that's your CLmax",
    "Stall occurs slightly after CLmax when the lift curve starts dropping sharply",
    "Examine Cp distributions near stall - you'll see flow separation on the upper surface moving forward from the trailing edge",
    "At high angles (>16°), convergence may fail - this indicates severe separation/stall"
