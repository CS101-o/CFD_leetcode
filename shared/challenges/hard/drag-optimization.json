  "description": "In aircraft design, achieving a target lift while minimizing drag is crucial for fuel efficiency and range. This challenge tests your understanding of airfoil selection and operating conditions.\n\n**Your Task**: Design a configuration that achieves CL = 0.80 ± 0.02 while minimizing drag coefficient (CD). You may:\n- Choose any NACA 4-digit airfoil (thickness 09-18%)\n- Select any angle of attack (-5° to 15°)\n- Set Reynolds number between 5e5 and 5e6\n\n**Your score depends on**:\n- Meeting the CL target (required)\n- Minimizing CD (lower is better)\n- L/D ratio (lift-to-drag ratio)\n\n**Learning Objectives**:\n- Understand the trade-offs between lift and drag\n- Learn about airfoil efficiency (L/D ratio)\n- Explore how thickness affects performance\n- Understand Reynolds number effects on drag\n\n**Success Criteria**: \n- CL between 0.78 and 0.82\n- CD < 0.0070 (excellent)\n- L/D > 100 (excellent efficiency)",

  "hints": [
    "Thinner airfoils generally have lower drag, but may not achieve high CL efficiently",
    "Cambered airfoils (non-zero first digit) can achieve target CL at lower angles of attack",
    "Higher Reynolds numbers typically reduce drag by delaying transition",
    "The optimal angle of attack balances pressure drag and skin friction",
    "Try NACA 2412 or 2415 at moderate angles (5-8°) with high Reynolds number",
    "Calculate L/D ratio: it's the ultimate measure of aerodynamic efficiency"
  ],

  "learning_objectives": [
    "Understand drag components (pressure drag vs skin friction)",
    "Learn about L/D ratio and its importance in aircraft design",
    "Explore airfoil selection criteria",

    "explanation": "The NACA 2412 at α=6.5°, Re=3e6 provides excellent efficiency. The 2% camber allows achieving CL=0.8 at a moderate angle where pressure drag is minimal. High Reynolds number keeps the boundary layer attached longer, reducing drag."
