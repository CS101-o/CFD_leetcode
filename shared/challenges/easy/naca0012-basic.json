  "description": "Welcome to your first CFD challenge! The NACA 0012 is a symmetric airfoil commonly used in aircraft tail surfaces and helicopter rotors.\n\n**Your Task**: Run a simulation of the NACA 0012 airfoil at 5° angle of attack and Reynolds number of 1 million. Predict the lift coefficient (CL) and verify it matches theoretical expectations.\n\n**Learning Objectives**:\n- Understand how angle of attack affects lift\n- Interpret lift coefficient (CL) values\n- Visualize pressure distribution around an airfoil\n- Learn about symmetric airfoils\n\n**Success Criteria**: Achieve CL between 0.50 and 0.60 (±0.05 tolerance)",
